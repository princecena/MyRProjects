# 
# 
# The Base Plotting System
#   -"Artist's palette" model
#   -Start with blank canvas and build up from there
#   -Start with plot function (or similar)
#   -Use annotation functions to add/modify (text, lines, points, axis)
#   
#   -Convenient, mirrors how we think of building plots and analyzing data
#   -Canâ€™t go back once plot has started (i.e. to adjust margins); need to plan in advance
#   -Difficult to "translate" to others once a new plot has been created (no graphical "language")
#   -Plot is just a series of R commands

# The Lattice System
#   -Plots are created with a single function call (xyplot, bwplot, etc.)
#   -Most useful for conditioning types of plots: Looking at how y changes with x across levels of z
#   -Things like margins/spacing set automatically because entire plot is specified at once
#   -Good for putting many many plots on a screen
# 
#   -Sometimes awkward to specify an entire plot in a single function call
#   -Annotation in plot is not especially intuitive
#   -Use of panel functions and subscripts difficult to wield and requires intense preparation

state <- data.frame(state.x77, region = state.region)
xyplot(Life.Exp ~ Income | region, data = state, layout = c(4, 1))

# The ggplot2 System
# -mixes elements of Base and Lattice
# -Splits the difference between base and lattice in a number of ways
# -Automatically deals with spacings, text, titles but also allows you to annotate by "adding" to a plot
# -Superficial similarity to lattice but generally easier/more intuitive to use
# -Default mode makes many choices for you (but you can still customize to your heart's desire)

library(ggplot2)
data(mpg)
qplot(displ, hwy, data = mpg)
#   -Cannot "add" to the plot once it is created
