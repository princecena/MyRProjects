# Base graphics are used most commonly and are a very powerful system for creating 2-D graphics.
# 
# > There are two phases to creating a base plot:
#   -Initializing a new plot
#   -Annotating (adding to) an existing plot

# > Calling plot(x, y) or hist(x) will launch a graphics device (if one is not already open) and
# draw a new plot on the device

# >If the arguments to plot are not of some special class, then the default method for plot is
# called; this function has many arguments, letting you set the title, x axis label, y axis label, etc.

# > The base graphics system has many parameters that can set and tweaked; these parameters are
# documented in ?par; it wouldnâ€™t hurt to try to memorize this help page!

# Some Important Base Graphics Parameters
# Many base plotting functions share a set of parameters. Here are a few key ones:
#   -pch: the plotting symbol (default is open circle)
#   -lty: the line type (default is solid line), can be dashed, dotted, etc.
#   -lwd: the line width, specified as an integer multiple
#   -col: the plotting color, specified as a number, string, or hex code; the colors() function gives
#   -you a vector of colors by name
#   -xlab: character string for the x-axis label
#   -ylab: character string for the y-axis label

# The par() function is used to specify global graphics parameters that affect all plots in an R
# session. These parameters can be overridden when specified as arguments to specific plotting
# functions.
#   las: the orientation of the axis labels on the plot
#   bg: the background color
#   mar: the margin size
#   oma: the outer margin size (default is 0 for all sides)
#   mfrow: number of plots per row, column (plots are filled row-wise)
#   mfcol: number of plots per row, column (plots are filled column-wise)


# Base Plotting Functions
#   plot: make a scatterplot, or other type of plot depending on the class of the object being plotted
#   lines: add lines to a plot, given a vector x values and a corresponding vector of y values (or a 2-
#                                                                                                 column matrix); this function just connects the dots
#   points: add points to a plot
#   text: add text labels to a plot using specified x, y coordinates
#   title: add annotations to x, y axis labels, title, subtitle, outer margin
#   mtext: add arbitrary text to the margins (inner or outer) of the plot
#   axis: adding axis ticks/labels
