# The Process of Making a Plot
# 
# When making a plot one must first make a few considerations (not necessarily in this order):
# - Where will the plot be made? On the screen? In a file?
# - How will the plot be used?
#     - Is the plot for viewing temporarily on the screen?
#     - Will it be presented in a web browser?
#     - Will it eventually end up in a paper that might be printed?
#     - Are you using it in a presentation?
# - Is there a large amount of data going into the plot? Or is it just a few points?
# - Do you need to be able to dynamically resize the graphic?
# - What graphics system will you use: base, lattice, or ggplot2? These generally cannot be mixed.
# - Base graphics are usually constructed piecemeal, with each aspect of the plot handled
#   separately through a series of function calls; this is often conceptually simpler and allows plotting
#   to mirror the thought process
# - Lattice graphics are usually created in a single function call, so all of the graphics parameters
#   have to specified at once; specifying everything at once allows R to automatically calculate the
#   necessary spacings and font sizes.
# - ggplot2 combines concepts from both base and lattice graphics but uses an independent
#   implementation
#We focus on using the base plotting system to create graphics on the screen device.


# Base graphics are used most commonly and are a very powerful system for creating 2-D graphics.
# 
# > There are two phases to creating a base plot:
#   -Initializing a new plot
#   -Annotating (adding to) an existing plot

# > Calling plot(x, y) or hist(x) will launch a graphics device (if one is not already open) and
#   draw a new plot on the device.The plot function is a generic function in R, and so, it has, it, it can behave   differently, depending on what kinds of data you pass to it. If you don't pass it a special type, piece of data, so, if you just pass it, if X and Y are, for example, vectors, then, you use what's called the default method for plot. 

# >If the arguments to plot are not of some special class, then the default method for plot is
# called; this function has many arguments, letting you set the title, x axis label, y axis label, etc.

# > The base graphics system has many parameters that can set and tweaked; these parameters are
# documented in ?par; it wouldnâ€™t hurt to try to memorize this help page!

hist(airquality$Ozone) ## Draw a new plot

# Scatterplot
with(airquality, plot(Wind, Ozone))

airquality <- transform(airquality, Month = factor(Month))
boxplot(Ozone ~ Month, airquality, xlab = "Month", ylab = "Ozone (ppb)")


# Some Important Base Graphics Parameters
# Many base plotting functions share a set of parameters. Here are a few key ones:
#   -pch: the plotting symbol (default is open circle)
#   -lty: the line type (default is solid line), can be dashed, dotted, etc.
#   -lwd: the line width, specified as an integer multiple
#   -col: the plotting color, specified as a number, string, or hex code; the colors() function gives
#         you a vector of colors by name
#   -xlab: character string for the x-axis label
#   -ylab: character string for the y-axis label

# The par() function is used to specify global graphics parameters that affect all plots in an R
# session. These parameters can be overridden when specified as arguments to specific plotting
# functions.
#   - las: the orientation of the axis labels on the plot
#   - bg: the background color
#   - mar: the margin size
#   - oma: the outer margin size (default is 0 for all sides)
#   - mfrow: number of plots per row, column (plots are filled row-wise)
#   - mfcol: number of plots per row, column (plots are filled column-wise)

# Default values for global graphics parameters

# Base Plotting Functions
#   - plot: make a scatterplot, or other type of plot depending on the class of the object being plotted
#   - lines: add lines to a plot, given a vector x values and a corresponding vector of y values (or a 2-
#          column matrix); this function just connects the dots
#   - points: add points to a plot
#   - text: add text labels to a plot using specified x, y coordinates
#   - title: add annotations to x, y axis labels, title, subtitle, outer margin
#   - mtext: add arbitrary text to the margins (inner or outer) of the plot
#   - axis: adding axis ticks/labels

So it doesn't put anything into the plotting region. It just makes a, it sets up all the other stuff in the plot without the actual data. And then as I, in order to put the data into the plot, I kind of go through subsets of the data frame.
